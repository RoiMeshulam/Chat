# What is this project?

This project is a live chat communicating with a server.

You have the option to talk with everyone in the chat, send a private messege and request to download content from the server

# The way we made our project:

We have made a few classes these next lines will explain them.

Server - this class is the main server that contains files(that you can download) and runs a thread to handle each client

Client - this class is for each client connecting. Starts with a login screen and only after the loging we acually create the class. A client can send a messege, send a private messege and download content from the server.

# How did we test our project?

There is a Testing class inside the project that tests all the main methods

# How to use our project!!

Please run the ServerSide.py
